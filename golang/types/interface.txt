1. interface - weighs 16: pointer to type, pointer to value. type contains dynamic array with methods

how methods are attached to structs:
type Method struct {
	name    string           
	handler func(interface{}) 
}

type TypeDescriptor struct {
	name         string   
	valueMethods []Method 
	ptrMethods   []Method
}

2. just compare struct method sets with interface methods sets
