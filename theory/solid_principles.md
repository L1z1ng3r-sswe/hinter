## SOLID Principles Details

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) <a id="single-responsibility-principle-srp"></a>

A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one job or responsibility.

---

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP) <a id="open-closed-principle-ocp"></a>

Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

---

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) <a id="liskov-substitution-principle-lsp"></a>

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

---

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) <a id="interface-segregation-principle-isp"></a>

Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Instead of one fat interface, many small, specific interfaces are preferred.

---

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) <a id="dependency-inversion-principle-dip"></a>

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
