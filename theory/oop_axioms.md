## OOP Axioms Details

### Encapsulation <a id="encapsulation"></a>

Controlled access to data through public methods.

---

### Abstraction <a id="abstraction"></a>

Achieved through interfaces that hide implementation details and expose behavior.

---

### Inheritance (Composition over Inheritance in Go) <a id="inheritance-composition-over-inheritance-in-go"></a>

Go uses composition instead of classical inheritance by embedding structs within other structs.

---

### Polymorphism <a id="polymorphism"></a>

Achieved through interfaces that allow different types to be treated uniformly as the interface type.
